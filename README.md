# Image Classifier Project for Flower Species Using PyTorch

I completed this project as part of Term 1 of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree. The goal of this project was to train a deep neural network on a data set of flower images, then to use this trained model to classify the species of flower for new images. 

This project uses PyTorch and the torchvision package; the Jupyter Notebook walks through the implementation of the image classifier and shows an example of the classifiers prediction on a test image. The classifier was also converted into a pyhton application which could be run from command line using "train.py" and "predict.py".
